const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const Analysis_of_Requirements = "The requirements asked of the consumer is defined here. Where we translate corporate jargin and requirements and translate them to what that looks like in code."
const design = "The team of developers design/create a psuedocode for delivering the product. Poker is played" 
const testing_and_integration = "Software is testing for bugs and checked to make sure there are no crashes or breaches. Applying the software to the intended use"
